# Webflux Controller Application
This application is a POC geared towards enabling users to create a new microservice with below points:
1. The Controller layer is created entirely with using Spring Reactive Webflux.
2. This has a `REST` API which internally calls a `SOAP` service.
3. This includes `HashiCorp Vault` integration as well for storing certificates and secrets outside of application configuration.

Further details will be added as and when this application is updated with other features.
